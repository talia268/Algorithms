Array will be divided to 2 parts consecutively according to merge sort algorithm.
Array --> [16,21,11,8,12,22]
            16	21	11       -         8	12	22    
       16	21		 11                       8 12	    22
16		21		11                               8		12		22

After the dividing process is done, numbers will be collected together until they are sorted correctly 

16		21		11			8		12		22
		16	21		11			8		12	22	
 		11	16	21			8	12	22		
				8	11	12	16	21	22


Big-O Notation: O(n*(logn))
